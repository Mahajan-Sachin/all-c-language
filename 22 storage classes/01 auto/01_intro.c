//C Storage Classes are used to describe the features of a variable/function.
// These features include the scope, visibility, and lifetime which help us to
// trace the existence of a particular variable during the runtime of a program.
// â€¢ There are four types of storage classes in C:
// 1. Auto
// 2. External
// 3. Register
// 4. static
// to specify the storage class for a variable, the following syntax is to be
// followed: storage_class var_data_type var_name;
//
